											<h3>What is ADER?</h3>
											<p>ADER is a source code extension to a widely used nuclear-energy-industry code, SERPENT 2.
											ADER, designed and built by myself - Daniel Wooten - adds an entire suite of optimization
											functionalities to SERPENT 2. ADER, composed of more than 30k lines of C code, is a
											first-of-its-kind nuclear simulation package allowing for high fidelity simulations of
											next generation nuclear reactors. Due to national security concerns only a redacted version of the
											code is available to the public - this is the github to which the link above directs.</p>

											<h3>Test driven development</h3>
											<p>From the begining of the project ADER was designed to be a living code. As such, not only are the
											comments and documentation geared towards future development but ADER started and released as a 
											test-driven project. Test-driven projects are those in which the code to test the product is written
											before the product is created. While incuring some overhead in the planning stages this approach tends
											to shed light on future problems long before they arise. Additionally, such an extensive test suite allows
											for future developers to be assured that their changes have not broken some other part of the product. This
											concern is particuarly important for products which interact with an environment of other platforms.</p>

										<h3>A goal was set</h3>
										<p>Myself, Susan Kilean Hwang, Susan Hao, and Zhimin Chen decided to build a computer vision system which would be
										able to label the displayed emotion on a given human face. With consultation from Frank Cleary we decided a system
										based on live webcam video had more potential future use.</p>

										<p>As a team we took this idea from the whiteboard to the web. We trawled the web for data, built and tested
										several models quickly selecting a transfer model based off of the VGG-16 architecture. Using cv2 greatly reduced the
										amount of back-end effort we would have had to put into image preparation for our model in the on-line pipeline.</p>

										<p>We successfully developed a Flask based web app which exceeded our expectations - in real time it was able to
										identify one or multiple human faces and correctly name the emotion present on those faces even as the faces
										transitioned their emotional state.</p>

										<p>With my background in engineering optimization I'm proud of what I see as my key contribution,
										saving the team a little 
										over a day in hyperparameter search time via a simple linear minimization approach. I enjoyed pair-coding and
										helping to build the various components of our model, user interface, etc., but saving the team time is my own
										contribution I can smile about.</p>
