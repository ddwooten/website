											<h3>What is ADER?</h3>
											<p>ADER is a source code extension to a widely used nuclear-energy-industry code, SERPENT 2.
											ADER, designed and built by myself - Daniel Wooten - adds an entire suite of optimization
											functionalities to SERPENT 2. ADER, composed of more than 30k lines of C code, is a
											first-of-its-kind nuclear simulation package allowing for high fidelity simulations of
											next generation nuclear reactors. Due to national security concerns only a redacted version of the
											code is available to the public - this is the github to which the link above directs.</p>

											<h3>Test driven development</h3>
											<p>From the beginning of the project ADER was designed to be a living code. As such, not only are the
											comments and documentation geared towards future development but ADER started and released as a 
											test-driven project. Test-driven projects are those in which the code to test the product is written
											before the product is created. While incurring some overhead in the planning stages this approach tends
											to shed light on future problems long before they arise. Additionally, such an extensive test suite allows
											for future developers to be assured that their changes have not broken some other part of the product. This
											concern is particularly important for products which interact with an environment of other platforms.</p>

										<h3>Building off of legacy code</h3>
										<p> The ADER code was the primary project of my graduate thesis at UC Berkeley. ADER was
										developed by myself, Daniel Wooten, and it represents a first-of-its-kind modeling
										solution for an emerging class of nuclear reactor. ADER exists as more than 30 thousand lines of
										C code written as a direct integration into the very popular nuclear simulation tool, SERPENT 2 -
										itself composed of more than 1 million lines of C code which is why ADER was written in C.</p>

										<p>I took ADER through every stage of development, from conception and whiteboarding to documentation
										and distribution. From the beginning ADER was designed with the end-user as the priority and the future
										developer always in mind. The error messages are plentiful and informative while the code comments are
										crisp and meaningful just as the code itself is clean and straightforward. 
										ADER's creation as a test-driven development saved myself dozens of hours
										in terms of debugging and adaptation. The development of ADER spanned many years and of course the
										design requirements and objectives changed along the way with its comprehensive test suite easing
										that process.</p>

										<p>Just because I built ADER does not mean I worked alone. ADER is an extension to an existing, and
										massive, nuclear simulation code which itself is in continual development as is the nature of leading
										research codes. As such the biggest challenge in creating ADER was integrating with and understanding
										the base code as it was not written cleanly or with future developers in mind. My favorite error message from
										SERPENT may have been "Error: [****] we shouldn't be here". That said, the development team for SERPENT 2
										is very easy to work.</p>

										<p>ADER is not my only software project by far, but it is my largest and one that I'm proud of - not because
										I 'completed' it but because I know I built it such that it would live on past my care of it.</p>
