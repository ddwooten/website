											<h3>What did I build?</h3>
											<p>I built a deep reinforcement A2C agent - policy gradient - to learn the time and
											sequence based preferences of users of streaming media services such as Netflix or
											Spotify or Pandora, etc. This modular agent is able to take in data from various
											sources and agents and then learn patterns found within the data, patterns which
											when verified against a hold-out set should show a better match to user's desired
											content choices than before. Better matching users choices enables a streaming
											service to provide and highlight content individualized to their users and more
											likely to be what a given user wanted, even if they didn't know it themselves.
											Higher value content delivered to users reduces user churn and in turn drives
											business profits.</p>

											<h3>It's all about the data!</h3>
											<p>The old adage, 'garbage in, garbage out' hold especially true in data science and
											machine learning - because your algorithm is learning from what you put in! If you give
											your algorithm too little or low quality, or poorly sample, pick your ill, if you give your
											algorithm bad data, it will learn 'bad' things. Give your algorithm a well-balanced and properly
											sampled data set of sufficient size and quality and will learn things you could have never hoped
											to find, if you built a good algorithm. This effect was plain as day with my work here. I passed
											to my recommendation engine the old and original Netflix 1 million movies data set - there simply
											wasn't enough information in the data about users sequential preferences to find any pattern. When
											I gave my algorithm the detailed listening histories of thousands of users from Spotify it quickly
										       	found users sequential preferences.</p>

										<h3>Better recommendations, happier users</h3>
										<p> As an Insight Data Science Fellow in New York City I immediately saw the business
										value in delivering better recommendations to users - I myself open up my Spotify Discover
										playlist ever week eager to see what music Spotify has found for me, I know that better
										recommendations bring value to the user.</p>

										<p>The niche I found that had yet to be addressed in the publicly available literature
										( inside word is that YouTube, Amazon, etc have been doing this for years ) was targeting
										users' sequential preferences, and with even more difficulty, targeting users' temporally
										variant sequential preferences. What does all of that mean? In the image above pretend that
										the album covers depict a song that user A listened to. Our job as the recommender system
										is to recommend to user A 3 songs that they might want to listen to where the grey box is.
										You and I both easily know that all three choices should be a Taylor Swift song but the truth
										is, this is a difficult thing to teach a computer.<p>

										<p>My first challenge was finding data as good data makes a quality product. I spent several
										days searching for the right data, discarding some sets, such as the Netflix 1 million movies
										set, and treasuring others such as the #nowplaying-RS dataset.</p>

										<p>While I knew there were several basic algorithms which could capture sequential patterns,
										such as LSTMs and CNNs, I knew that model iteration would be part of my process and so I built
										a framework to process data from arbitrary sources and feed this data to a given model for
										assessment. With this framework I was able to quickly iterate on datasets and models finding the
									       	right balance between accuracy and prediction speed as users have very little tolerance for lag.
