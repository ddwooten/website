											<h3>What is DanBot?</h3>
											<p>DanBot is my very own chatbot. I created DanBot primarily as a demonstration
											of my skills but what better use of my skilled-time than to help myself get a
											job? I created DanBot to answer basic questions a hiring manager might want to
											ask me, for example, "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a co-worker."
											Is DanBot perfect, no product is! Is DanBot a proof-of-concept, of course! 
											Can DanBot answer your questions about my educational background, sure can!</p>

											<h3>Until I have a technical side-column</h3>
											<p>I thought I'd include a little tid-bit about my hobbies and interests. Yes that's me
											in the above photo and yes, I LOVE snowboarding. I'm a huge fan of mountains in general
											from big to small and anyway you can enjoy a mountain is fun in my book - backpacking,
											hiking, climbing, white-water rafting, you name it. When I'm not clambering over a
											mountain I'm a storyteller. I live for stories. I write a little and I do oral story
											telling. I of course love books, particularly sci-fi and fantasy, and what good nerd
											doesn't enjoy games, both board and video. When I can I enjoy traveling, I've spent 16 weeks
											driving across North America and the biggest surprise was that Montana stole a piece of my
											heart, if you haven't been, that state is beautiful. Alrighty, those are the quick points,
											I have to leave something to the imagination.</p>

										<h3>The journey to DanBot</h3>
										<p> This page is set up a running blog of my journey towards creating my chatbot. I'll try
										to provide some insight into the process here on this page. I got the idea to create DanBot
										as I'm currently applying for a job on a chatbot creation team. To boot my interview was moved
										10 days forward so I figure I can get familiar with chatbots in that time. Besides, I wanted to
										start working on a new project now that this website is up and running.</p>

										<p>So here we are! Now, the first part of any project, after ideation, is feasibility analysis. Is
										this possible? Do the tools exist? Am I overselling my abilities? Well, chatbots are a known thing,
										I intend on using existing libraries such as RASA or DialogFlow, and I've built ML systems in the 
										past. I've even done a good bit of work with sentiment analysis through BERT. Add to this my many
										many years of experience as a physical simulations specialist ( so step by step process kinds of things )
										and I know this is a project I can sink my teeth into. Next question, the interview is supposedly in
										10 days, can I get an MVP (minimum viable product) going in 10 days? Now that I'm shaky on. If the
										pre-built libraries are easy to work with and have the functionality I need, of course, I can hit that
										mark. If not, I can have something ready by then but it may well be a work in progress still.</p>

										<p>So it's possible, so what's next. Identifying the tools I want to use, and scoping out how this is
										done by people who have done it before me. To this end, I always begin with a simple google search,
										something to the tune of "building my first chatbot".</p>

										<h3>Configuring SpaCy</h3>
										<p> I mentioned I wasn't going to reinvent the wheel and so the NLU (Natural Language Understanding)
										library that I'll be using is SpaCy. SpaCy is a python NLU library intended for industrial level usage
										and I've decided to use it because it's what a company I have an upcoming interview with uses and I'd like
										to get familiar with it. That said, just from the get-go, SpaCy is well documented and it looks clean.</p>

										<p>On day 3 I went through SpaCy's introduction course and I thought it was very well designed -
										I certainly left with an idea of how I would use SpaCy in this project</p>

										<h3>It all lives on the web!</h3>
										<p>Day four has been all about the backend webserver side of this project. I configured an AWS EC2 t2large
										instance to handle user input and response. Now, I could have let the DanBot page be entirely hosted on the
										AWS EC2 instance, and that would have been easier. That said, I wanted the page to still function if I took
										my EC2 instance down and so I decided to host the DanBot page and direct user input/response to the EC2 
										instance via a simple https post/get.</p>
