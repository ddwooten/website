											<h3>What did I build?</h3>
											<p>I built a deep reinforcement A2C agent - policy gradient - to learn the time and
											sequence based preferences of users of streaming media services such as Netflix or
											Spotify or Pandora, etc. This modular agent is able to take in data from various
											sources and agents and then learn patterns found within the data, patterns which
											when verified against a hold-out set should show a better match to user's desired
											content choices than before. Better matching users choices enables a streaming
											service to provide and highlight conent individualized to their users and more
											likely to be what a given user wanted, even if they didn't know it themselves.
											Higher value content deliverd to users reduces user churn and in turn drives
											business profits.</p>

										<h3>Building off of legacy code</h3>
										<p> The ADER code was the primary project of my graduate thesis at UC Berkeley. ADER was
										developed by myself, Daniel Wooten, and it represents a first-of-its-kind modeling
										solution for an emerging class of nuclear reactor. ADER exists as more than 30 thousand lines of
										C code written as a direct integration into the very popular nuclear simulation tool, SERPENT 2 -
										itself composed of more than 1 million lines of C code which is why ADER was written in C.</p>

										<p>I took ADER through every stage of development, from conception and whiteboarding to documentation
										and distribution. From the beginning ADER was designed with the end-user as the priority and the future
										developer always in mind. The error messages are plentiful and informative while the code comments are
										crisp and meaningful just as the code itself is clean and straightforward. 
										ADER's creation as a test-driven development saved myself dozens of hours
										in terms of debugging and adaptation. The development of ADER spanned many years and of course the
										design requirements and objectives changed along the way with its comprehensive test suite easing
										that process.</p>

										<p>Just because I built ADER does not mean I worked alone. ADER is an extension to an existing, and
										massive, nuclear simulation code which itself is in continual development as is the nature of leading
										research codes. As such the biggest challenge in creating ADER was integrating with and understanding
										the base code as it was not written cleanly or with future developers in mind. My favorite error message from
										SERPENT may have been "Error: [****] we shouldn't be here". That said, the development team for SERPENT 2
										is very easy to work.</p>

										<p>ADER is not my only software project by far, but it is my largest and one that I'm proud of - not because
										I 'completed' it but because I know I built it such that it would live on past my care of it.</p>
