											<h3>In short...</h3>
											<p>Working with a team of 3 other exceptional graduate students at UC Berkeley we built a computer
											vision system which not only identifies one or many human faces in live webcam video but, in real time,
											assigns emotional content to the human face(s) in question.</p>

											<h3>Pushing Product Faster</h3>
											<p>Transfer learning is one technique by which the time to the MVP can be cut significantly.
											Transfer learning takes advantage of prior-built models which may be related to the MVP and rather than
											train a brand new model from scratch, makes small adjustments to an existing model such that it may
											accomplish a different task than what it was originally designed for. For example, VGG-16 is a facial
											recognition model with more than 100 layers. We froze a large number of these layers in place and made small
											adjustments to the top most layers enabling a model created from VGG-16, with very little training time, to
											recognize not individual faces but the emotions displayed on individual faces.</p>

										<h3>A goal was set</h3>
										<p>Myself, Susan Kilean Hwang, Susan Hao, and Zhimin Chen decided to build a computer vision system which would be
										able to label the displayed emotion on a given human face. With consultation from Frank Cleary we decided a system
										based on live webcam video had more potential future use.</p>

										<p>As a team we took this idea from the whiteboard to the web. We trawled the web for data, built and tested
										several models quickly selecting a transfer model based off of the VGG-16 architecture. Using cv2 greatly reduced the
										amount of back-end effort we would have had to put into image preparation for our model in the on-line pipeline.</p>

										<p>We successfully developed a Flask based web app which exceeded our expectations - in real time it was able to
										identify one or multiple human faces and correctly name the emotion present on those faces even as the faces
										transitioned their emotional state.</p>

										<p>With my background in engineering optimization I'm proud of what I see as my key contribution,
										saving the team a little 
										over a day in hyperparameter search time via a simple linear minimization approach. I enjoyed pair-coding and
										helping to build the various components of our model, user interface, etc., but saving the team time is my own
										contribution I can smile about.</p>
