										<p>I have a passion for solving complex problems with simple data driven solutions.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>With more than 7 years of Python and C/C++ development experience
									I know a thing or two about going from a customer need to a served
									solution. That road begins and ends with good teams and good teams are
									built on great communication. Having worked with many different people across
									different backgrounds and projects I look forward to finding out how we can
									work together on our most pressing challenges.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Aside from a lifetime of team-building and leadership,
									I have developed deep expertise in software development
									and project management. From
									whiteboard to user manual I have seen projects through every
									stage of the development pipeline. I've worked in Agile teams and
									I've worked in quality control teams. My focus 
									is data-adaptive algorithms which use static or dynamic data
									to inform business decisions; i.e. machine learning.</p>

							<h2>From the heart of AI</h2>
							<p>A graduate degree from UC Berkeley</p>
						</header>
						<p>As the data science revolution began in the San Francisco Bay area so to did my
						graduate work as I started my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in 2013. My thesis, already centered
						on the use of 100 GB+ data sets, quickly became interwoven with the rapidly
						expanding data community at UC Berkeley. Having been an original member of the
						Berkeley Institute for Data Science I more heavily integrated data science and 
					       	machine learning into my thesis, qualifying and earning my designated emphasis in
						computational and data science engineering.</p>

							<h2>A Fellowship in Machine Learning</h2>
							<p>Fellow of the Insight Data Science class of 2020</p>
						</header>
						<p>Having completed my graduate work in December of 2019 I knew I
						wanted to begin my career in Machine Learning with the right network,
						and with the right mentors and so I sought out the Insight Data Science
						Fellowship. Having watched as Insight grew from a class of 6 people in the
						bay area to a national organization with more than 3000 alumni my confidence
						in their methods going into the program was fully affirmed by the end of the
						program. At Insight, I had the distinct pleasure of working on Agile teams
						with professionals from many fields as well as the gratification of completing
						my own solo-built recommendation engine.</p>
